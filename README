System info
===========

grunt and snort are backup VMs on anansi and aragog respectively.
They use the standard amd64 guest kernel with 2 vCPUs, 4G RAM, virtio
network and 3T virtio disk, backed with LVM RAID1 over two SATA HDD PVs.

The entire virtio disk /dev/vda is used for the ext4 root filesystem.
